# ObjectDetectionWithColour
Deprecated version of opencv with C. Finding features/object in a video that has a specific colour.

As stated above, 90% of the source code is written in C, but I started learning C++ and wanted to start making it practical. So I added one class. One can just implement the same class as a function to keep it to C only. 

Use  :~$ pkg-config --libs opencv
to find location of opencv header files to be linked during compiling.
